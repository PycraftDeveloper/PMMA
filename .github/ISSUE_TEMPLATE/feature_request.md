**Describe the feature to us:**
_For example: I really want to see support for rendering 3D shapes using PMMA._

**Do you have any examples of this feature in action so we can check it out?**
_Its always a good idea to provide examples of this feature from other places, especially if you want to see something like this in PMMA._

**Do you have any code to help us design this feature?**
_We would always appreciate a suggestion with some backing in code (of any kind, ideally the ones we use in the repo, but we aren't too picky - just no low level languages (please!)). If you are unable to provide code that is also fine. Please ensure that if you didn't create the code, you have permission to be able to submit it here._

**Urgency**
_Please let us know how urgently you need this feature request, if you don't then we will prioritize it internally. If this is for a business or academic project let us know and we will prioritize addressing your issue._

**What happens next?**
After you submit a feature request to us, we will react to the message to indicate we are reviewing your input. Then we will try and get back to you as soon as possible with an idea if we are pursuing this feature or not.

* If we choose to add this feature request we will let you know when this feature will be added to PMMA (remember we are a small team.) Then close the issue once that feature has been added and documented.

* If we choose not to go through with your suggestion (the unlikely option) then don't be disheartened, we continually review and make changes to PMMA so your feature may get reconsidered again at another time.
