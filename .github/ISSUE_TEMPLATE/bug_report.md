**Describe the bug**
_A clear and concise description of what the bug is._

**To Reproduce**
_A program that can be used to replicate the issue. Ideally this should be a minimal example, but sometimes that isn't possible as the result occurs between the interaction of multiple PMMA mechanics. Also we would really appreciate an example that can reliably replicate the issue, **but if its an intermittent issue then please let us know so we don't immediately dismiss the issue as having been fixed as we continue to work on the API.**_

**Expected behavior**
_A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen, and what happened instead._

**Screenshots**
_If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem._

**Platform Information:**
- What Operating System are you using?
- What version of that Operating System is it?
- What GPU do you have?
- Does your CPU support AVX in any way?
- Did you use a pre-compiled version of PMMA or a custom build?
- Which version of PMMA are you using?

**Do you have any thoughts on what could be causing the issue?**
* If you do, don't hesitate to let us know, the more information we have the sooner we can resolve the issue. Feel free to suggest any code fixes here!
* If you don't, then don't worry we will investigate regardless.

**Additional context**
_Add any other context about the problem here. If possible it would be great to see any logs from PMMA you have, and it would be very useful for us if you could turn on logging for all types (Debug, Info, Warnings and Errors) and share those logs too._

**What happens next?**
After you submit a bug report to us, we will react to the message to indicate we are reviewing your input. Then we will try and get back to you as soon as possible with an idea of when this issue might be resolved. We may also ask for more specific information before being able to fix the issue, we will respond to the issue with any questions and close the issue when it is resolved.

**Urgency**
_There is no need to specify an urgency when it comes to bugs, we will prioritize bug fixes over anything else._
