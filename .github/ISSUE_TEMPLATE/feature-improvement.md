**Describe what portion of the API could be improved.**
_For example: I think the color portion of the Number Formats API could be improved._

**What improvement would you make?**
_For example: I think adding support for HSL and other color formats would be good._

**Do you have any suggestions on how we would make those improvements?**
_For example: URLs, code or graphical examples. Please ensure you have permission to share any additional resources like code or graphical examples._

**Urgency**
_Please let us know how urgently you need this feature improvement, if you don't then we will prioritize it internally. If this is for a business or academic project let us know and we will prioritize addressing your issue._

**What happens next?**
After you submit a feature improvement to us, we will react to the message to indicate we are reviewing your input. Then we will try and get back to you as soon as possible with an idea if we are pursuing this feature or not.

* If we choose to add this feature improvement we will let you know when this feature will be added to PMMA (remember we are a small team.) Then close the issue once that feature has been added and documented.

* If we choose not to go through with your suggestion (the unlikely option) then don't be disheartened, we continually review and make changes to PMMA so your feature improvement may get reconsidered again at another time.
