Welcome to PMMA's Documentation!
In writing this documentation, we have operated on a "content-first" principle.
This means that whilst things will largely look similar to other documentation you will find online for other projects - there is additional user-friendly syntax designed to provide in depth at-a-glance information. This at-a-glance syntax is outlined below:

Firstly, lets walk you through our deployment indicators. These are the colored squares found before each namespace (the names you will use to call PMMA's library).
* The green square - ðŸŸ© - indicates that this code **is safe** to use in your projects, as it's unlikely to be modified in any-way in future updates to PMMA.
* The yellow square - ðŸŸ¨ - indicates that this code **is safe** to use in your projects as it's likely to have its name changed, but won't change in functionality or in its inputs and outputs (I/O).
* The orange square - ðŸŸ§ - indicates that this code **isn't suitable** for deployment, as its likely to have its name and/or its inputs and outputs (I/O) changed - its functionality won't change.
* The red square - ðŸŸ¥ - indicates that this code **isn't suitable** for deployment, as its likely to have its name and/or its inputs and outputs (I/O) changed and/or its functionality may also be changed.

*Currently things are a bit of a work in progress as we write the documentation, bear with us!
