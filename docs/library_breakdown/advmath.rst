Math (``pmma.Math``)
====================

ðŸŸ© **R** - A standalone class that extends the range of built-in mathematical operations to expose all of the advanced mathematical operations used within PMMA.
This class also currently uses Numba for JIT (just-in-time) compilation (in no-python mode) as required.

Required 3rd-party modules: Numba, Numpy and Pyrr.
