## PMMA Troubleshooting

Welcome to the troubleshooting page for PMMA, here you will find an extensive list of all the issues we have faced when ourselves using PMMA that will hopefully help you sort out the issue you are having. We have split our guide based on operating system as most of the issues faced are generally platform specific.

If you built your own version of PMMA manually, please also select the operating system that best represents the platform you had the issue on.

If you find a problem that's not listed here, let us know in the [issues page](https://github.com/PycraftDeveloper/PMMA/issues) and we will do our best to help resolve the problem and update our troubleshooting guide!
