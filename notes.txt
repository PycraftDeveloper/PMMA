Minimized: 10
Minimized power saving: 7.5 (10*0.75)

De-Focused power saving: 22.5 (30*0.75)

Introduce number -> word and number <- word systems
Introduce prefix adjustments for SI-units.
Introduce Coodinate and Degree conversions.
Introduce anti-aliasing, improve VBO creation and allow easier loading of other moderngl objects.
Add object collision.
