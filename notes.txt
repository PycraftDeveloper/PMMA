Issues
======
Crashes on display full screen toggle (and maybe resize) due to opengl context / window context. Release all OpenGL objects and recreate them? Link to custom moderngl wrapper.
Transparent display not working with opengl idk why.

TO DO LIST
==========
Work on MIDI events when able to do so.

Integrate events with custom event manager
Create aggregated events like Pointer (similar to controller already added).

Introduce prefix adjustments for SI-units.
Introduce Coodinate and Degree conversions.
Introduce anti-aliasing, improve VBO creation and allow easier loading of other moderngl objects.
Add object collision.                                                                   ^
