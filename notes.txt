Issues
======
Crashes on display full screen toggle (and maybe resize) due to opengl context / window context. Release all OpenGL objects and recreate them? Link to custom moderngl wrapper. Partially fixed - colors not however (and manually setting color has no effect either). Creating custom objects is a must!
Transparent display not working with opengl idk why.

TO DO LIST
==========
Add in Coordinate and color intermediaries for render pipeline
Work on MIDI events when able to do so.

Integrate events with custom event manager
Create aggregated events like Pointer (similar to controller already added).

Introduce prefix adjustments for SI-units.
Introduce Coordinate and Degree conversions.
Introduce anti-aliasing, improve VBO creation and allow easier loading of other moderngl objects.
Add object collision.                                                                   ^

Wrap ModernGL & ModernGL_window objects through PMMA to enhance existing behavior, including deletes.
