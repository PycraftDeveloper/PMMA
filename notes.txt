Notes
-----
Add typehint for returned classes at least where unclear (for intellicode) - eg:

...
    def get_controller(self, controller_index) -> 'Controller':
        return _Registry.pmma_module_spine[Constants.CONTROLLER_INTERMEDIARY_OBJECT].get_controller(controller_index)
...

When adjusting the number of segments in circular shapes, or shapes with varying numbers of points, make sure to also update color data too!

Module Initialization Order
---------------------------

Built in (standard library)

External (pip)

Internal TopLevel (pmma.__init__ / pmma.c_setup / pmma.setup)

Internal (pmma.py_src./)

Internal Utility (pmma.py_src.utility./)

*ONLY import required modules.

Search
======
Search for public attributes of a class: self.([A-Z]|[a-z])+

Issues
======
Transparent display not working with opengl, potentially signs of a bigger problem.
Rendering Polygon fails.
Rendering shapes need to be updated when window resized. Note though that this breaks pretty much all positioning and shapes so IDK what to do about that at the moment lol.

UNCONFIRMED RELEASE SCHEDULE
============================
Work on MIDI events when able to do so. Update: Not possible with Pygame, will need to do more RnD first.
Work on handling ALSA audio error messages in video.py.
Magic number in video playback: ~198: `                _time.sleep(0.48)` not sure yet what this means

RELEASE SCHEDULE
================
[BUG FIX] - An issue that needs urgent addressing. Should be tackled first.

[EXTENSION] - A new feature that extends an existing idea.
[NEW FEATURE] - An entirely new feature/mechanic.

Preparing for next release:
	[BUG FIX] Few issues in some realtime audio effects - test these and try and fix.
	[IMPROVEMENT] Improve Shape Rendering.
	[IMPROVEMENT] shapes should only be drawable to the display - slight tweak

	[NEW FEATURE] Add collisions to shapes.
	[EXTENSION] Add paths as extension from transitions.
	[EXTENSION] Add camera as extension from perspective.
	[IMPROVEMENT] Add back in Images.
	[BUG FIX] Adjust shape indexes in render pipeline
	[IMPROVEMENT] Add back in render pipeline.
	[NEW FEATURE] Add in collision detections for all shapes.
	[NEW FEATURE] Add in 3D shapes (sphere, rectangle, n-prism, n-equivalent of 2D shapes)
	[NEW FEATURE] Introduce prefix adjustments for SI-units.
	[NEW FEATURE] Create aggregated events like Pointer (similar to controller already added).
	[IMPROVEMENT] Noise generation value defaults to application run time.
	[IMPROVEMENT] Try to detect on-screen displays like RTSS and adjust rendering mode accordingly.

Following releases:
	[BUG FIX] Fix perlin noise for arrays.
	[NEW FEATURE] Introduce loading of custom 3D AND 2D objects from file or array.
	[NEW FEATURE] Introduce skybox.
	[NEW FEATURE] Introduce collisions for 3D objects and scenes.
